# Agentic-AI-2D-Shooting-Game

This is a Human-AI Hybrid Battle Royale simulation built using Python and Pygame. The project features four autonomous Heuristic AI agents competing against a human-controlled player with decoupled, screen-relative controls. Our core innovation is proving that highly competitive, emergent gameplay can be created using only simple, agent-based heuristic rules, successfully developing a robust simulation without resorting to complex machine learning models.
